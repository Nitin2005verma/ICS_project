- Linear Sum of two matrices.
- Multiplication of two matrices.
- Transpose of a matrix.
- Determinant of a Matrix of max size=100.

**Concepts used in this project are:**
- 2 dimensional arrays
- if else conditions
- for loop
- Functions and Recursion
- Maxsize function
- break;continue; keywords

## Execution Instructions
First user will see four options ordered 1 to 4. 
- 1.Linear Sum of matrix
- 2.Multiplication of two matrix
- 3.Transpose of matrix
- 4.Determinant
 - According to the need of user, he/she selects one. 
Accordingly the program asks user to input more data about the matrix operation that they wanna perform.
As inputs the information, it will ask for info for next few steps. At last it shows the correct ouput.
